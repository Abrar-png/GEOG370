        This map shows the median household income in each county in the Eastern United States. I chose this area of 
        the US because this is where I reside and know best and I was curious how the household income was distributed. 
        Originally, I was only going to focus on one state, however I thought it would be fun to include a bigger area and 
        see if you can distinguish state boundaries based on median household income. Looking at the map you cannot really establish
        state boundaries based solely on income as it seems relatively equal. However, you can see that the Triangle has a higher income and the area
        around Richmond, Virginia has a pretty high income as well.
