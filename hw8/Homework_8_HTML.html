    <h3>Method</h3>
    <p>
        For the map, I first zoomed in on Pilot Mountain and the areas surrounding it. Then, I imported in the data for Pilot Mountain as a polygon. From there I manually created a line layer
        that represented US Highway 52. Then I created a 500 meter buffer around the highway. Then, I used the intersection method to see the areas where the buffer overlapped with the state park,
        which represents the park areas affected by noise pollution. I asked this question because I believe it is important to preserve nature whenever we can and having a highway going right beside 
        a state park is not environmentally friendly.
