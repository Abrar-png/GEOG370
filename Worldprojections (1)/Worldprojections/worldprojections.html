    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">Describe in your own words how you displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p>First, I downloaded the Indicatrix Mapper plugin into QGIS. This plugin allows Tissot's indicatrix to be calculated based on
        the given projection. After this, I imported the vector map into QGIS, and then
        on the bottom right corner of the window, there is an indicator that tells the user
        what the current projection is. Upon clicking this, I was able to change
        the projection. The plugin will also automatically recalculate Tissot's indicatrix.</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection attempts to keep the map as equidistant as possible. However, in preserving the distance, 
        this projection sacrifices shape and size. This is evident as the projection moves toward the poles, the shape 
        stretches horizontally and becomes enlarged.</h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection shows the curvature of the Earth, and attempts to curve the projection in 2D.
        This causes the projection to be accurate at the Equator and the Prime Meridian but sacrifices the shape at 
        the right and left sides of the map.

    <h2>Pseudo Mercator</h2>
    <h3>This projection aims to preserve the shapes of the countries but causes the size and distance to become distorted
        the further you get from the Equator.

    <h2>Sphere Winkel</h2>
    <h3>This projection portrays the Earth's curvature and tries to conserve distance. 
        However, the projection stretches the map vertically and this stretch is more noticeable
        the closer you get to the poles.

    <h2>Cylindrical Equal Area</h2>
    <h3>This projection portrays the globe as the surface of a cylinder with equal diameter and height as the sphere.
        This conserves the size of countries for the most part, but as you move towards the poles, the countries get
        stretched horizontally.

    <h2>World Equidistant Conic</h2>
    <h3>This projection portrays the globe as the surface of a cone with equal base diameter and height as the sphere.
        This causes the point of the cone to be more accurate and portrays the world as being viewed from the top. However,
        as the projection moves away from the center(south), the shapes get stretched horizontally and the sizes get larger.

    <h2>North Pole Azimuthal Equidistant</h2>
    <h3>This projection is similar to the World Equidistant Conic projection. This projection attempts to keep verticle distances
        as equidistant as possible as the projection moves from north to south. Despite this, the map still becomes distorted in size
        and shape as the projection moves towards the edge.

    <h2 style="color:red">Now, you should <u>add the following projections on your own:</u></h2>
    <h3>EPSG: 3857, 53018, 54034, 54027, 102016, and two additional projections that you choose.</h3>
